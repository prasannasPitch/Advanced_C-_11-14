# Features in C++ 11 / 14

## Range Based Loops :

C++11 added the feature of for statement to allow for easy iteration over a range of elements. All of the STL containers that have begin/end pairs will work with the range-based for loop.

## Regular Expressions :

Validating the user input was always a problem in C++, especially when the user is supposed to enter a number. Regular Expressions are validation function returns true if the expression is a match against the given string otherwise it returns false.

## Auto Keyword :

Auto avoids unnecessary typing of complex data types on the left hand side of assignment operator. Before C++ 11, each data type needs to be explicitly declared at compile time, limiting the values of an expression at runtime but after C++ (11 or more), many keywords are included which allows a programmer to leave the type deduction to the compiler itself. it's a useful way of simplifying object declarations as well as cleaning up the syntax for certain situations.

## Lambda Functions :

## Datastructures and Complexity :
